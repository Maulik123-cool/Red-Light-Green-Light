# Red-Light-Green-Light

Red Light, Green Light is a fun and intense web-based mini-game inspired by the hit series Squid Game. In this game, you're a player trying to reach the finish line while a creepy doll watches over you.

You can only move forward when the doll says "Green Light", but the moment it turns to "Red Light", if you move even slightly, you’re caught and eliminated

Can you survive the Red Light, Green Light challenge? Move only when the doll isn’t looking… One wrong move during red light, and it's GAME OVER. 💀
